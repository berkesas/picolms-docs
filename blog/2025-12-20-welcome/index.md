Introducing Pico LMS

<!-- truncate -->

The purpose of Pico LMS is to create a library of re-usable components in React and adjacent habitats to make it easy to create apps for teaching and learning.

We start by creating components for displaying and grading various types of questions. The library will continue to expand in the future.

Here are some ideas for the future:

- Stabilize the library, theming
- Add more dynamic features
- More question types
- React Native components
